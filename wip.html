	<div class="article">According to wikipedia "Computer programming" (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. <br></br>
		<p>Okay lets understand this in a simple way. The computer which you use is just like a "blank box". It won't be able to perform any kind of operations on its own. It has to be given a set of instructions to be able to carry out any operations. That "set" of instructions is known as "Programs". Thus "Computer Programs" tell the computer about what action it has to perform, and obviously this set of instructions has to instructed by the users. 	</p><br></br>
		<P>Many times you have come across the term "Programming Languages". So lets understand what does it mean. Like us, the human beings who can speak and understand instructions in many different languages(for eg:- English, Hindi, French, Spanish, etc) , the computer also can perform operations instructed in many different programming languages. They are just tools to make the computer perform a specific task. Basically a Computer only understands "Binary", ie, only the digits '0' and '1'. The programming languages are just there to make our (the users) tasks easier. The whole detail of the programming procedure(read "compilation" and "interpretation" process) we will be completing in detail later.
