	<div class="subheading">(dd/mm/yyyy)</div>

	<div class="article">Many of us write codes and execute them. But do all of us (well, mostly the newbie I guess :P) know the underlying process that converts a source code to an executable program? Not many I guess. This article's for all those Not-Manys who are looking for the secret ;)  
		<p>"Programmers write programs in a form called source code. Source code must go through several steps before it becomes an executable program. The first step is to pass the source code through a compiler, which translates the high-level language instructions into object code. The linker combines modules and gives real values to all symbolic addresses, thereby producing machine code."		</p>
		<P>The above the lines explain the entire process of compilation. So basically, you have a program, called <b>source</b> code, which must undergo the process of <b>compilation</b> to produce an output with the help of an <b>executable program</b>.
		</P>
		<p>So, if there's a "compilation" process, there must be a tool to perform this work. Yes, there is one such thing and it is known by the name of a <b>compiler</b>. Now let us see what a compiler is exactly.
